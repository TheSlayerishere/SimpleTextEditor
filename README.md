# SimpleTextEditor

This is a very simple text editor made in C# with the gui made using avalonia

## Features

It only supports reading and  writing from one file for now, can load and save text

## what's coming on next

It needs a LOT  of changes to add making multiple files etc, 
that a normal text editor will do, that stuff is underway but progress will be slow since I have exams and school
